# ABSTRACT

In this project the user can understand and monitor the power usages. The power consumption can be easily monitored by using a smart energy meter. It is much needed for measuring the overall energy consumed. Here the current source is used as input, the LED is setup to detect a particular outbound of incoming current. The display is fixed to showcase the power consumed and this setup acts as an energymeter. Current Sensing is done where a binary number system has only two digits that are 0 and 1. Every number (value) represents with 0's and 1's in this number system. The base of binary number system is 2 as it has only two digits. Calculations are done by using the octal number system has only eight (8) digits from 0 to 7. Every number (value) represents with 0,1,2,3,4,5,6 and 7 in this number system. The base of octal number system is 8, because it has only 8 digits. Over Current Protection is done with the decimal number system has only ten (10) digits from 0 to 9. Every number (value) represents with 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 and 9 in this number system. The base of decimal number system is 10, because it has only 10 digits. Here the over current is indicated by using the LED light, which glows when the current input crosses a particular value.
