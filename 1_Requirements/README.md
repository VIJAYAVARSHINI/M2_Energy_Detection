Requirements
Introduction
In this project the user can understand and monitor the power usages. We can easily monitor power consumption using a smart energy meter. Its useful and needed for measuring the overall energy consumed.


SWOT ANALYSIS

Strenghts:
1.With number system convertion users can convert a given number system to any other number system. 
2.Users can save their time, without finding it manually. 
3.Users can reduse the time and effort.
4.Easy to get the Output.

WEAKNESS:
1.Vulnerable to viruses. 
2.May handle critical damage.

Oprtunity:
Used for measuring purpose can also develop to a smart energy meter by including many more features.

Threats:
Application may crash somtimes.
Can hit error when given huge value, this may damage the equipment.

4W's and 1'H
Who:

Resiential Consumers, Industrial owners

What:

Used for easy and fast tracking

When:

Demand Basis

Where:

As a retro-fit in industries
Small scale manufacturing units
